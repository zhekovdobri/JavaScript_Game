## Description
The idea of this project came along time ago and the reason was a collage of mine who dreamed to become a pizza master chef. He neglected all his job as a programmer and start to make a pizza. Nothing wrong with that Alex! That is why I decided to help him creating this project. The project represents a simple form to order food and drinks thru this app. I use here a reactive forms to manage the user input. That is why the first thing after my app creation was to import { ReactiveFormsModule } in to "app.module.ts".
<br />

`import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';`

<br />
The project starts with a header and component which presents the header background image.

```
<div class="header">
    <app-images></app-images>
</div> 
```
I used string interpolation to make my "food" and "drinks" components reusable. This way the code is much more clearer and short for use. Then I can put this reusable template with code where I want and change its value when I want. For this purpose I created into the components ".ts" file an array which holds the parameters with my desired values. 
```
export class HotDrinksComponent implements OnInit {
    
    data3 = [{
        label:'Cappuccino: ',
        src:'assets/images/Cappuccino.png',
        formControlName:'cappuccino'
    },{
        label:'Mocha: ',
        src:'assets/images/Mocha.png',
        formControlName:'mocha'
    },{
        label:'Americano: ',
        src:'assets/images/Americano.png',
        formControlName:'americano' 
    }];
    }
```
Then into the component ".html" file I created a template which uses a string interpolation {{keyword.array}} to display my parameters values and an "ngFor" loop directive which iterates my array content.
```
<div class="container margin-30">
   <div class="card">
     <div class="card-body">
         <form [formGroup]="form">
            <h2 class="text-center">Hot drinks</h2>
            <div *ngFor="let item of data3">
               <label>{{item.label}}</label>
               <div class="form-control-1">
                  <img class="pizza" src="{{item.src}}" alt="coffe" width="42" height="42" >
                  <app-counter-input class="quantity h-100" formControlName="{{item.formControlName}}" style="width: 105px;" ></app-counter-input>
               </div>
            </div>
            <pre class="form-values">
               {{ form.value | json }}
             </pre>
         </form>
      </div>
   </div>
</div>
```
On this project I used SCSS instead CSS. Next to it I created a form which hold the "food" and the "drinks" selectors.  and another form which contains the inputs for "name-address-phone". The "food" and "drinks" forms along with "address-name-phone" form have at the bottom json pipe {{ value_expression | json }}. Json pipe converts a value into its JSON-format. When the customer typing his order, json changing it's value on the bootm of the page. In to the all of my components in theirs "ts" file I have used the "createFomr()" method, which contains the definition of my form fields. The exception is the "counter-input" component.
